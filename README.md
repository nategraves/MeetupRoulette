Meetup Roulette
===============

Meetup Roulette is exactly what it sounds like; click a button, RSVP to a nearby Meetup.

Initial Setup
-------------

There are a few things you will need to run this project:

1. Git - http://www.freshblurbs.com/installing-git-os-x-3-minutes
	- If this gives you any trouble with `make`, you probably don't have the OS X dev tools installed. These should be on the disc that came with your Mac

2. Django - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/topics/install/

Any questions, I'm on AIM pretty much 24/7 (hovertruck), or available by email (daniel@venodesigns.net)
